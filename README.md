I'm making this python-based API for ZKTeco fingerprint readers because I couldn't find the official one.
I found that there were a lot of security holes in the web interface of these devices. So I told myself that I would use them to create a json API to communicate with these devices.

As I am referring to the web interface and I intend to use python, I will use the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

If something changes and the develop continues to go well, I will put a mini documentation in the readme as soon as a functional module becomes available.
